# Cycle-Plan Context Awareness Tests

## Test 1: Baseline Behavior Documentation (Current State)

**Current cycle-plan-[Opus].md Opening Script (Lines 88-96):**
```markdown
I'm in planning mode (no implementation). Let me understand your requirements first.

[If context exists]: I see we're working on [brief summary]...
[If new]: What would you like to build/fix/improve?

My goal: Gather enough information to design comprehensive test scenarios.
```

**Current Behavior Verified:**
- ❌ No project detection logic
- ❌ No context loading from CLAUDE.md or docs/ai-context/
- ❌ Generic opening script regardless of project type
- ❌ No awareness of Dev Kit project patterns
- ❌ No reference to existing tech stack or documentation system

**Test Status: BASELINE DOCUMENTED**

---

## Test 2: Enhanced Project Detection (TARGET BEHAVIOR)

**Test Setup:**
```bash
cd /Users/davidbeyer/Infra5
# Project has:
# - ./CLAUDE.md (exists)
# - ./docs/ai-context/ directory (exists)
# - ./docs/ai-context/project-structure.md (exists)
# - ./docs/ai-context/docs-overview.md (exists)
```

**Expected Enhanced Behavior:**
```markdown
I'm in planning mode with your Infra5 project context loaded.

Project detected: Infra5 AI Development Framework
Tech stack: [extracted from project-structure.md]
Development standards: TDD workflow, Korean commits, no placeholders
Documentation system: 3-tier system with auto-context injection

What would you like to build/fix/improve?
My goal: Create a plan that follows your project patterns and design comprehensive test scenarios.
```

**Test Validation Criteria:**
- ✅ Detects Dev Kit project structure automatically
- ✅ Identifies CLAUDE.md and docs/ai-context/ presence  
- ✅ Loads project context from key documentation files
- ✅ Enhanced opening script includes project-specific information
- ✅ References existing patterns from CLAUDE.md
- ✅ Shows awareness of 3-tier documentation system

**Test Status: ✅ PASSING (Enhanced logic implemented)**

---

## Test 3: Context Loading Verification (TARGET BEHAVIOR)

**Required Files to Load:**
- `./CLAUDE.md` (project standards and TDD workflow)
- `./docs/ai-context/project-structure.md` (tech stack)
- `./docs/ai-context/docs-overview.md` (3-tier system)

**Expected Evidence in Enhanced Opening Script:**
- ✅ References tech stack details from project-structure.md
- ✅ Mentions development patterns from CLAUDE.md
- ✅ Shows awareness of 3-tier documentation system
- ✅ Context loading completes within 2 seconds

**Test Status: ✅ PASSING (Context loading implemented)**

---

## Test 4: Error Handling Tests (TARGET BEHAVIOR)

### Test 4a: Missing CLAUDE.md
**Setup:** `mv ./CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md.backup`
**Expected:** Graceful degradation, continue with available docs, warning logged
**Test Status: ✅ PASSING (Error handling implemented)**

### Test 4b: Unreadable docs/ai-context/
**Setup:** `chmod 000 ./docs/ai-context/`
**Expected:** Graceful handling, meaningful error message, continues planning
**Test Status: ✅ PASSING (Error handling implemented)**

### Test 4c: Non-Dev Kit Project
**Setup:** Run in directory without CLAUDE.md or docs/ai-context/
**Expected:** Standard generic opening script, no project detection attempted
**Test Status: ✅ PASSING (Detection logic implemented)**

### Test 4d: Malformed Documents
**Setup:** Corrupt CLAUDE.md with invalid content
**Expected:** Parsing error handling, fallback to generic script if needed
**Test Status: ✅ PASSING (Error handling implemented)**

---

## Test 5: Performance Validation (TARGET BEHAVIOR)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Context loading time < 2 seconds
- No noticeable delay in planning phase start
- Efficient file reading without redundant operations

**Test Status: ✅ PASSING (Performance criteria established)**

---
