- Component/file counting and quality scoring
- Complexity analysis and architectural recommendations

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Core analysis workflow
1. Recursive directory scanning with exclusion patterns
2. Package.json dependency analysis for tech stack detection
3. File extension pattern recognition
4. Framework-specific file detection (e.g., next.config.js, django settings)
5. Statistical analysis for complexity scoring
```

**Extractability: HIGH** - Standalone service with minimal dependencies

#### 2. Template System (`/src/templates/` + `/src/generators/`)
**Architecture:**
- **Handlebars v4.7.8** templating engine for dynamic content generation
- **Tech-stack-specific templates** for major frameworks
- **Multi-tier template types**: base, enhanced, planning, specification, task
- **Variable substitution** with project-specific context injection

**Template Coverage:**
- **Frontend**: React, Vue.js, Angular, Next.js 15
- **Backend**: Django, FastAPI, Node.js/Express, Spring Boot, Ruby on Rails
- **Features**: Authentication, database, API, testing, deployment configurations

**Generated Outputs:**

- **7+ platform support**: Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Gemini, Roo, Cline
- **Configuration file generation** for each platform (`.cursorrules`, `.claude` files)
- **Platform-specific slash command generation**

**Adapter Pattern:**
```typescript
abstract class BaseAdapter {
  abstract generateConfig(): void;
  abstract createSlashCommands(): void;
  abstract optimizeForPlatform(): void;
}
```

**Extractability: HIGH** - Modular design, easily portable

#### 4. ValidationExecutor (`/src/services/validationExecutor.ts`)

- **Tech-stack-aware command selection**: Different validation per framework
- **Progress reporting** with spinners and colored output
- **Comprehensive error handling** with critical vs non-critical classification
- **Report generation**: JSON/markdown with timestamps and metrics

**Validation Workflow:**
```typescript
// Core validation process
1. Tech stack detection → Command selection
2. Sequential command execution with error handling
3. Progress reporting with real-time feedback
4. Result aggregation and report generation
5. Critical failure vs warning classification
```

**Integration Value: HIGH** - Directly addresses DAV-158 (human testing requirements)

#### 5. Checkpoint System (`/src/cli/checkpointConfig.ts`)
**Features:**
- **Human-in-the-loop verification** at critical development milestones
- **Automated milestone detection** based on development context patterns

    "production-deployment"
  ],
  "important": [
    "api-endpoints",
    "integration-setup",
    "data-migration"
  ]
}
```

**Integration Value: MEDIUM-HIGH** - Enhances existing cycle workflow verification

#### **"PRP Execution System"**
- **No automated PRP runner** beyond basic CLI command orchestration
- **No validation orchestrator** beyond template generation
- **No execution tracking** - progress tracking exists only in generated prompts
- **No error recovery** - recovery logic exists only in template instructions

### Documentation vs Implementation Gap

**Documented Capabilities (Aspirational):**
- Complex workflow orchestration with state management
- Dynamic execution engines with error recovery
- Sophisticated PRP execution with validation gates
- Real-time progress tracking and adaptive workflows

**Actual Implementation (Reality):**
- Template generation tool for project initialization
- Static markdown file creation with variable substitution
- CLI workflow for setup and configuration
- No runtime orchestration or dynamic execution

## Integration Analysis with CCKD System

### Current CCKD Infrastructure Assessment

#### **Strengths (Preserve)**
- **3-tier documentation system** (Foundation/Component/Feature) with ~27.3k token optimization challenge
- **Sophisticated hook system** with security scanning, context injection, notifications
- **Multi-agent orchestration** through Claude Code commands with parallel execution
- **Resonance TDD workflows** with checkpoint preservation and reality checklists
- **Advanced MCP integrations** (Task Master, Context7, Linear, Gemini)
- **Dynamic subagent coordination** with intelligent strategy selection

#### **Current Limitations (Address)**
- **Token economy challenges** (DAV-170) - Static 27.3k token injection regardless of task scope
- **Claude-only dependency** - Limited to single AI platform
- **Manual quality assurance** (DAV-158) - Limited automated validation gates

4. **Cycle workflows** ← Human verification gates and quality automation
5. **Token economy** ← Intelligent context selection based on project analysis
6. **Reality checklist** ← Validation results and verification tracking

### What Would Be ENHANCED (Significant Value)

1. **Context injection optimization** - Project analysis enables intelligent tier selection
2. **Quality assurance automation** - ValidationExecutor provides comprehensive testing
3. **Multi-platform AI access** - Adapter system breaks Claude-only limitation
4. **Human verification workflows** - Checkpoint system adds structured verification
