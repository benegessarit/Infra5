## Session State Management

### Context Checkpointing System
Importance: 95
- Three-tier documentation hierarchy maintains context across AI sessions
- Checkpoints store document classifications and checksums
- State preservation through cycles/*/HHMM-topic-checkpoint.json format
- Automatic context resurrection on session reconnection

### Context Injection Workflow
Importance: 90
- Four distinct context profiles with token budgets:
  - minimal: 5000 tokens (foundation only)
  - component: 12000 tokens (single domain)
  - focused: 18000 tokens (cross-component)
  - comprehensive: 25000 tokens (system-wide)
- Dynamic profile selection based on task complexity

## Cross-Component Communication

### Agent Orchestration Pattern 
Importance: 85
- Strict read-only advisory mode for secondary agents
- All modifications route through primary AI controller
- Session correlation IDs track cross-agent communication
- Mandatory validation at integration boundaries

### Documentation Flow
Importance: 80
- Content migration between documentation tiers based on scope analysis
- Cross-reference management preserves relationships
- Auto-topic inference drives documentation attachment
- Progressive context building through dialogue cycles

## Workflow Integration

### Issue Management Flow
Importance: 75
- Parent-child issue relationship tracking
- Automated state transitions based on workflow stage
- Workspace context preservation between sessions
- Integration with Linear issue tracking system

### Handoff Protocol
Importance: 70
- Auto-detection of session achievements
- Smart merging of progress with existing context
- Dynamic sectioning based on work relationships
- Completion state management across handoffs
