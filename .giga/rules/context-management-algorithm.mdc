# context-management-algorithm

The context management system implements a sophisticated approach to maintaining AI agent state and optimizing context usage across sessions.

## Core Components

### Context Tier System
- 3-tier documentation hierarchy for preserving AI context:
  - Tier 1: Foundational documentation (CLAUDE.md, project structure)
  - Tier 2: Component-level documentation (CONTEXT.md)
  - Tier 3: Feature-specific documentation
- Maintains checkpoints with checksums for documentation tracking

### Context Profiling System
Four distinct context profiles with token limits:
- minimal: Foundation only (5000 tokens)
- component: Single domain focus (12000 tokens) 
- focused: Cross-component (18000 tokens)
- comprehensive: System-wide (25000 tokens)

### Context Injection Rules
- 4.6x token multiplication factor for system context overhead
- Dynamic loading based on task complexity markers
- Conditional loading rules for different prompt types
- Session persistence with state tracking
- Automatic context hierarchy enforcement

### Component Pattern Detection
Specialized detection for:
- resonance: TDD cycle management 
- orchestration: Agent coordination
- contextIntelligence: Documentation loading
- testing: Validation frameworks
- integration: External systems

### Task Analysis Logic
- Simple query detection based on command patterns
- Multi-component task detection
- Agent allocation rules (2-6 agents based on complexity)
- Impact assessment for context inclusion

### Session Management 
- Problem lifecycle-based session handling
- Context evolution tracking
- Progressive context building through dialogue
- State preservation between AI interactions

Importance Scores:
- Context Tier System: 95
- Context Profiling: 90 
- Context Injection Rules: 85
- Component Pattern Detection: 80
- Task Analysis Logic: 75
- Session Management: 70
