## Core Orchestration Components

### Dynamic Agent Allocation System
- Scales between 2-6 agents based on task complexity analysis
- Agent specialization rules:
  - Code Review: Security, Performance, Architecture
  - Implementation: Component Expert, Integration, Testing
  - Documentation: Content Classification, Migration
- Business rules for task complexity classification:
  - Simple query patterns: 2-3 agents
  - Multi-component tasks: 4-6 agents
  - Cross-domain integration: Full team allocation

### Inter-Agent Communication Protocol
- Session-based architecture with explicit state boundaries
- Mandatory correlation ID for cross-agent messages
- Strict read-only advisory mode enforcement
- Knowledge synchronization through tiered documentation system

### Context Management Engine
File: src/commands/smart-context-injection.ts
- Profile-based context allocation:
  - minimal: Foundation only (5000 tokens)
  - component: Single domain (12000 tokens)
  - focused: Cross-component (18000 tokens)
  - comprehensive: System-wide (25000 tokens)

### Agent Specialization Framework
File: .claude/commands/code-review.md
- Mandatory coverage areas:
  - Critical path analysis
  - Security surface evaluation
  - Performance impact assessment
  - Integration points validation
- Dynamic role assignment based on project context

### Workflow Intelligence
File: .claude/commands/handoff.md
- Auto-detection of session achievements
- Context preservation between agent handoffs
- Progress tracking with completion state management
- Smart work merging with conflict resolution

Importance Scores:
- Agent Allocation System: 95
- Communication Protocol: 90  
- Context Management: 85
- Specialization Framework: 80
- Workflow Intelligence: 75
