# documentation-tier-system

## Tier Classification System
Importance Score: 95
- Three-tier documentation hierarchy for AI context preservation:
  - Tier 1: Foundational documentation (system architecture, project structure)
  - Tier 2: Component-level documentation (domain patterns, subsystems)
  - Tier 3: Feature-specific implementation details

## Content Classification Framework 
Importance Score: 85
- Automated content placement logic determines appropriate tier:
  - Codebase size thresholds (15/75 files boundaries)
  - Technology complexity metrics
  - Architectural dependency depth
  - Documentation state assessment

## Content Migration Rules
Importance Score: 80
- Intelligent content migration workflow between tiers:
  - Up-migration triggers: Pattern emergence, reuse across features
  - Down-migration triggers: Implementation specificity, limited scope
  - Cross-reference preservation during migrations
  - Content deduplication with smart merging

## Documentation State Management
Importance Score: 75
- Documentation synchronization with change detection
- Registry management for tracking tier relationships
- Cross-tier dependency mapping
- Content preservation rules during restructuring
